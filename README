The Working Computer
bugmo@theworkingcomputer.biz.ly

Program to facilitate computer use by people who have never used and/or are afraid of using them. Helps also with gradual adjustment to tasks necessary for safe and productive use of a personal computer.

Initial interface in vb.NET for easy coding and installation on windows machines. Probably later code in python/kivy to fit with the InteractiveFeedbackAI project.
